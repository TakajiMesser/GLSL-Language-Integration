attribute
compatibility profile only and vertex language only; same as in when in a vertex shader

const
a variable whose value cannot be changed

uniform
value does not change across the primitive being processed, uniforms form the linkage between a shader, OpenGL, and the application

varying
compatibility profile only and vertex and fragment languages only; same as out when in a vertex shader and same as in when in a fragment shader

buffer
value is stored in a buffer object, and can be read or written both by shader invocations and the OpenGL API

shared
compute shader only; variable storage is shared across all work items in a local work group
