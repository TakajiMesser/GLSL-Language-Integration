attribute
Compatibility profile only and vertex language only; same as in when in a vertex shader.

const
A variable whose value cannot be changed.

uniform
Value does not change across the primitive being processed, uniforms form the linkage between a shader, OpenGL, and the application.

varying
Compatibility profile only and vertex and fragment languages only; same as out when in a vertex shader and same as in when in a fragment shader.

buffer
Value is stored in a buffer object, and can be read or written both by shader invocations and the OpenGL API.

shared
Compute shader only; variable storage is shared across all work items in a local work group.
